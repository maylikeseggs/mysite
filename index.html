        <div><p>My name is May W and I love eggs, obviously! I'm 19 and currently enrolled in University of Colorado in Boulder Colorado! I haven't chosen a major yet, but it's okay because I'm only in my first year and working on getting my essential credits down first! I'm thinking about going into either English or Education to be an English teacher, not sure which one would be more fun. I'll try and keep this website updated, sort of like a blog, but who knows what it will end up as! In the mean time, follow me on Instagram @MayLikesEggs (shocker, I know!)</p></div>

        <p>NOTE: This site is still completely under construction, I'm not sure what plans I have for it, but I'd like to make it a lot better than it currently is!</p>
